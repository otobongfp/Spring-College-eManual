                <h4 style="text-align:justify;">An 'Ambassador' is a diplomat of the highest rank, accredited as representative from one country to another. In other words, one who has the quality of being honorable and having a good name of representing His kingdom or empire (the domain ruled by an emperor or empress, simply the region over which imperial dominion is exercised under common ownership in another kingdom or empire).</h4>
                <h4 style="text-align:justify;">He (Ambassador) must have passed and scaled through an Ambassadorial training and interview and is accredited before his empire or country presents to him with an Ambassadorial permit of operation, to represent them in country of service.Bringing it to the rational and systematic study of religion and its influences and of the nature of religious truth, an "Ambassador of Christ"' is one who has received the kingdom mandate or commission of spreading abroad the Good News of the kingdom of Jesus Christ in a country or kingdom of service, i.e. the world we find ourselves as commanded in 2Cor. 5:20, Mark 16:15, Matt. 28:19, Luke 24:48.</h4>
                <h4 style="text-align:justify;">As commissioners of the heavenly kingdom we are to be qualified of honor and of a good name, so that our country which Jesus Christ is the emperor will suffer no shame but will be proud of us as His Ambassadors, our earnest desire should be fulfilling the mission mandate of enlarging the kingdom and being in dominion over all other kingdoms because if we disappoint Him, He will disown us and cast us away in the end for not fulfilling the master's mandate (2 Tim. 2:12). This discipleship training manual aims at giving you a solid foundation for fulfilling God's kingdom increase. Be steadfast, watchful and maximize this opportunity, Shalom.</h4>
                <h4 style="margin-top: 50px;">At the CASOR SPRING COLLEGE we groom the next generation of Ambassadors, with the message of the Kingdom. It's amazing how much we do not know and the possibilities that still exists to learn...</h4>
