                <div style="margin-top: 50px;">
                    <h4 style="text-align:justify;">It all began at SINKOR CHAPEL, Monrovia Liberia at about 8:40p.m. (Liberian time) on Thursday 18 March, 1971. Note the mention of exact date and time. This T makes the historical account more than authentic.</h4>
                    <h4 style="text-align:justify;">On this memorable night, I was taken up in the spirit during an evening prayer meeting with John Towah, Raster Wuseye and one other brother whose name I can no longer recall. Note also the mention of specific names to confirm authenticity. I fell into a state of being mentally alert and yet experience things beyond the physical. It was in this state of sub-consciousness that I received my call into the ministry. The detail of the call is another story. It was on this night that CASOR was born. CASOR was not founded in Nigeria. CASOR was born in SINKOR chapel Monrovia Liberia. That night, I saw the sowing of the tiny corn that has blossomed into a gigantic tree.</h4>
                    <h4 style="text-align:justify;">I was ordered that night:</h4>
                    <h4 style="text-align:justify;">1.	To return to Nigeria and begin a campus ministry to teach God's children in the Universities and other Higher Institutions with the gospel and Bible teachings so that they do not derail and depart from the faith after their education.</h4>
                    <h4 style="text-align:justify;">2.	To bring students to remain loyal to the Church. I was born an Assemblies of God child.</h4>
                    <h4 style="text-align:justify;">3.	To evangelize the campus community and win staff and students to Christ. I was an Assemblies of God pastor's child who needed people to get saved.</h4>

                    <h4 style="color: #611635;">IN THE DAYS OF SMALL BEGINNINGS</h4>
                    <h4 style="text-align:justify;">In June 1971 (after three months of wrestling with the Lord whether I should return to Nigeria or remain stubborn to the call), I boarded the ship, MV, NNAMDI AZIKIWE and sallied from the port of Monrovia back to Nigeria, having been stopped on my planned journey to the Netherlands in pursuit of further education. I returned to Nigeria, set to carry out the SINKOR mandate.</h4>
                    <h4 style="text-align:justify;">Having been checkmated back to where 1 rightly belonged and in order to have a strong ministerial base since I had no ambition to become President/Founder of a Campus Outreach Ministry, 1 presented a memorandum to the Assemblies of God Executive Committee during its sitting at Enugu in September, 1971. At this memorandum, I formerly briefed the Executive Committee on my call and mandate and requested its blessing to go into campus ministry under the auspices of the Church which had not such outfit prior to this time. The Executive Committee directed that I must first be trained to become a pastor and 1 accepted.</h4>
                    <h4 style="text-align:justify;">Soon, on return to Nigeria, I began to fulfill the SINKOR Vision by becoming an itinerant evangelist with Brother Emma Uche, now Barrister Emma Uche who assisted me in small measure. I began the ministry of CASOR from my humble village house in old Umuahia, Abia State. This outreach was first called CHI ALPHA (Greek for CHRIST AMBASSADORS). But because of the wrong pronunciation of CHIALPHA, I changed it to ASSEMBLIES OF ADVANCE STUDENTS NATIONAL CONTENTION Uche and I also began the publication of a magazine called PENTECOSTAL AWAKENING. This magazine died a natural death when I enrolled, full time, into Assemblies Bible College, Old Umuahia. From 1 972/974, 1 was put on hold and the ministry of Outreach was continued, via exchange of letters with secondary school students, by the then Assemblies of God Christ Ambassadors National Director, Late Rev. Dr. E.A.E. Umo (rtd).</h4>
                    <h4 style="text-align:justify;">The Executive Committee, at its sitting in September, 1974, taking a cue from my memorandum, resolved to establish Campus Ministry as a unit of the General Council Christ Ambassadors Department. So, after my graduation from the Bible College in 1974, the Executive Committee felt it was time to grant me full mandate to pursue and fulfill the SINKOR Vision. The Executive Committee renamed the outreach, Christ Ambassadors Students Outreach (CASOR) and formerly appointed me first National Director with effect from January, 1975.</h4>
                    <h4 style="text-align:justify;">In April, 1975, I moved the make-shift CASOR office from Old Umuahia to Nsukka. This aim was to use the University of Nigeria as a springboard and to build CASOR UNN as a model, it was from Nsukka that what was CASOR Directorate, made up of my wife (whom I married in 1975) and I, launched out to lay the foundation of a global edifice now called CASOR Nigeria. By the end of 1976, we had established CASOR beach heads in nine centers.</h4>
                    <h4 style="text-align:justify;">1.	University of Nigeria</h4>
                    <h4 style="text-align:justify;">2.	University of Ibadan</h4>
                    <h4 style="text-align:justify;">3.	Alvan Ikoku College of Education</h4>
                    <h4 style="text-align:justify;">4.	CASOR Lagos Chapter at 111 C/egg Street, Surulere for all Tertiary Institutions within Lagos Metropolis.</h4>
                    <h4 style="text-align:justify;">5.	CASOR Port Harcourt at 105 Aggrey Road for all tertiary institutions within Port Harcourt Metropolis.</h4>
                    <h4 style="text-align:justify;">6.	CASOR Calabar Chapter (at 98 Fosbery Street Nelson Mandela Street) for all tertiary institutions within Calabar environs.</h4>
                    <h4 style="text-align:justify;">7.	University of Jos.</h4>
                    <h4 style="text-align:justify;">8.	Ado Bayero University.</h4>
                    <h4 style="text-align:justify;">9.	University of Ife.The chapters flourished until 1977 when I personally chose the late Rev. Christian Aniemeke as my successor and handed over the baton of CASOR to him while I traveled out of the country to further studies.</h4>
                    
                    <h4 style="color: #611635;">THE ENLARGED VISION</h4>
                    <h4 style="text-align: justify;">CASOR vision was small and foreclosed. But today, the vision has expanded tremendously. If it had remained as received by me, CASOR would not have made the giant strides we see now. CASOR membership then was restricted. Today, CASOR has metamorphosed to a global ministry that transcends denominationalism.</h4>
                    <h4 style="text-align: justify;">The 21st century CASOR has the responsivity of ensuring that the early vision is sustained and the enlarged vision fulfilled. CASOR Nigeria has come to stay, she is a Colossus. She is a Rock. CASOR Nigeria is setting the pace and the standard. She is the ace fellowship on university campuses across the nation. She is the best thing that has happened to campus outreach in the 21st century. She is the number one. CASORITES are the crusaders of or time. The impact of CASOR is obvious by the avalanche of testimonies on facebook from CASORITES whose lives witnessed great transformation through CASOR ministry.</h4>
                    <h4 style="text-align: justify;">In present day CASOR, I see a new vision. I see a vision of CASORITES who will leave behind a good memorial, a legacy and foot prints on the stand of CASOR history. I see a vision of a CASORITE(S) today who will transform and reform the church and restore the lost glory of the youth. I see a vision of a CASORITES who will be a guru, who will build a financial empire, who will transform the economic and social life of our people all in the fear of God and in dignity of man.</h4>
