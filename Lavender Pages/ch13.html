                <h3>SANCTIFICATION & CHRISTIAN DISCIPLINE</h3>
                <img class="img-thumbnail2" src="Discipline2.png">

                <!-- THIS IS THE INTRO PAGE CONTENTS -->
                <div style="margin-top: 50px;">
                    <h4 style="text-align:justify;">The word "Sanctification" means "Holiness", a state of being holy, it also means "to set apart as sacred". This calls for the Christians' overall separation unto God. We are expected as people who are born of God to be holy, sacred in all areas of our lives. It demands full commitment, resignation and surrendering unto God without any reservation, hence, God demands, "be ye holy..." (1 Pet. 1:13-16).</h4>
                    <h4 style="text-align:justify;">a.	It means separation from evil (1 Thess. 5:22).</h4>
                    <h4 style="text-align:justify;">b.	It means separation unto God (2 Tim. 2:19-22).</h4>
                    <h4 style="text-align:justify;">Sanctification deals with our character and conduct, as God's children. God declares us justified by faith but then by the Holy Spirit we become righteous. This is an ongoing process that starts at repentance.</h4>
                    
                    <h4 style="color: #611635;">WHAT SEPERATION TELLS</h4>
                    <h4 style="text-align:justify;">•	We are in the world but not of the world (1 Jn. 4:5-6; James 4:4; Jn. 15:18-19; 17:14-16)</h4>
                    <h4 style="text-align:justify;">•	Be not unequally voiced with unbelievers (1 Cor. 6:14-18). Do not love the things of the world (1 Jn. 2:5-17; 1 Jn. 4:4)</h4>
                    <h4 style="text-align:justify;">•	Do not share in the sins of Babylon (Rev. 18:4-5).</h4>
                    <h4 style="text-align:justify;">•	Remain true to your first love (God) (Rev. 2:4-5).</h4>
                    <h4 style="text-align:justify;">1.	Is sanctification optional for the believers or God's will for him? (1 Pet. 1:15-16) It is not optional but it is necessary for fruitful life (Jn. 15:8-16).</h4>
                    <h4 style="text-align:justify;">2.	With what does one get sanctified?</h4>
                    <h4 style="text-align:justify;">a.	The word of God (Jn. 17:17; 5:3)</h4>
                    <h4 style="text-align:justify;">b.	The Holy Spirit (Rom. 15:16)</h4>
                    <h4 style="text-align:justify;">c.	The blood of Jesus (Heb. 13:12).</h4>
                    <h4 style="text-align:justify;">3.	Through what channel does the Lord effect our sanctification? Refer to our study IV on temptation, trial, sufferings and persecution, etc.</h4>
                    <h4 style="text-align:justify;">4.	Is sanctification a continuous process or a once and for all affair? Remember our being set apart by God starts immediately, at our repentance. This means that it is both spontaneous and progressive in as much as we desire to live for God daily.</h4>

                    <h3 style="color: #611635;">DISCIPLINE</h3>
                    <h4 style="text-align: justify;">A disciple by definition is a follower, one who accepts and assists in spreading the doctrines of another. A Christian Disciple is commissioned to spread the gospel of Jesus Christ. Christian Discipleship is the process by which disciple grow in the Lord Jesus and are equipped by the Holy Spirit who resides in our hearts to overcome the pressures and trials of this present life and become mere and more Christ like. This requires that the Christian responds to the Holy Spirit prompting to examine their thoughts, words and actions and compare them with the Word of God. This requires that we be in the word daily - studying it, erasing over it and obeying it. In addition, we as disciples should always be ready to give testimony (confidently making known our faith) for the reason of the hope that is within us (1 Pet. 3:15) and to disciple others to walk in His way. It is of essence to note that the purpose of this topic is to awaken our consciousness to the task given Christ to every Christian. Discipleship is in two folds: you are mean to be discipled (to have a disciple and to have a disciple(s) a person(s) you are bringing up in the way of Christ). According to scriptures, being a Christian disciple involves personal growth characterized by the following:</h4>

                    <h4 style="color: #611635;">1.  Putting Jesus first in all things (Mark 8:34-38)</h4>
                    <h4 style="text-align: justify;">The disciples of Christ need to be set apart from the world. Our focus should be on our Lord and pleasing Him in every area of our lives. We must put off self-centeredness and put on Christ centeredness.</h4>

                    <h4 style="color: #611635;">2.  Following Jesus' teachings (John 8:31-32)</h4>
                    <h4 style="text-align: justify;">We must be obedient children and doers of the word. Obedience is the supreme test of faith in God (1 Sam. 28:18) and Jesus is the perfect example of obedience as He lived a life on earth of complete obedience to the Father even to the point of death (Phil. 3:5-8; Heb. 5:7-12). We must walk as Jesus did.</h4>

                    <h4 style="color: #611635;">3.  Fruitfulness (John 15:5-8)</h4>
                    <h4 style="text-align: justify;">Our job is to abide in Christ and if we do, the Holy Spirit will produce the fruit and this fruit is the result of our obedience. As we become more obedient to the Lord and learn to walk in His ways, our lives and hearts changes and an overflow of this is new conduct (thoughts, words and actions) representatives of that change. The change we seek is done from the inside cut through the power of the Holy Spirit. It isn't something we can conjure up on our own.</h4>

                    <h4 style="color: #611635;">4.  Love for other disciples (John 13:34-35)</h4>
                    <h4 style="text-align: justify;">The love of others is the evidence of our being a member of God's family (l John 3:10). It is not an emotion but an action, (1 Cor. 13:1-13). Furthermore, we are to think more highly of others than ourselves and to look out for their interests (Phil. 2:3-4). Verse t sums up what we are to do when it comes to everything in life. Our attitude should be the same with that of Jesus Christ. He is perfect example to us for everything we are to do in our Christian walk.</h4>

                    <h4 style="color: #611635;">5.  Disciples of others (Matthew2S:18-20)</h4>
                    <h4 style="text-align: justify;">Christ's words at ascension to heaven were "Go and make disciple of all nations". This is Christ's chosen method of spreading the good news of salvation. We are to share our faith and tell nonbelievers about the wonderful changes that Jesus has made in our lives. No matter what our maturity level in the Christian life, we have something to offer. Too often, we believe the lie from Satan that we don't really know enough of haven't been a Christian long enough to make a difference. Not true, some of the most enthusiastic representatives of the Christian life are new believers who have just discovered the awesome love of God. They may not know a lot of bible verses or the accepted way of saying things, but they have experienced the love of the living God and that is exactly what we are to share, God wants to use you. It is time to make Him known.</h4>
