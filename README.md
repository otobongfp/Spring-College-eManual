# Spring-College-eManual
Due to the covid pandemic I had to find a creative means to make study materials available to members of my fellowships ambassadors training school. I was appointed provost and after trying social media for sometime I looked for a creative means to solve the problem of inclusion and this was it. It I will integrate smaller features with time. Most of it is built entirely with Html and Css.
