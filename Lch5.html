                    <h5 style="text-align:justify;">CASOR as a body started in the then Rivers State University of Science and Technology (RSUST), now Rivers State University (RSU), Post Harcourt during the 1984/1985_session with only five members and a coordinator through the concerted effort of Bro. recognized member of the Nigeria Fellowship of Evangelical Students (NIFES). His action was misunderstood and thought to be rebellion. However, he continued and established what has now become a great campus fellowship in this institution. The person who started it with him were:</h5>
                    <h5 style="text-align:justify;">Bro. Henry Amadi, Bro. Kaka Wuwu, Bro. Emmanuel Amadi, Bro.Okechukwu Akiri and Bro. John Igwe, Bro. Edet Asim was the coordinator for 1984/1985 session and 1985/1986 session. The basic trust of his leadership was the building of the young fellowship and evangelism/soul winning.</h5>
                    <h5 style="text-align:justify;">From this humble beginning, CASOR RSU has grown like a mustard seed to become one of the biggest fellowships on campus with the prospects of further growth and increase. The fellowship has maintained the original mission statement or campus outreach/evangelism, holiness without compromise, encouragement of academic excellence, modesty in living and in dressing and biblical doctrine and teaching.</h5>
