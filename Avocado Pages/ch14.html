                    <h4 style="color: #9a7922;">A. TEMPTATION</h4>
                    <h4 style="text-align:justify;">Jesus Christ gave us the eight beatitudes in the great Sermon on the Mount, recorded for all posterity in the gospel of Matthew, the first book of the New of Testament of the bible. The ten commandments given to Moses on mount Sinai in the Old Testament book of Exodus, relates n series of "thou shalt not(s)", evils one must avoid in daily life on earth. In contrast, the message of Jesus was one of humility, charity and brotherly love. He taught transformation if the inner person. Jesus presented the beatitudes in a positive sense, virtues in life which will ultimately lead to reward. Any life void of beatitudes is a misery.</h4>
                    <h4 style="text-align:justify;">The beatitudes cover the glorious hope and reward the believer can expect, now as well as in eternity. It is the teachings of the Messiah to His disciples. Jesus calls His disciples-people to live at a higher level than the rest of the world. His call brings many other tests along the way, for test always follow the call-in order to prepare the believers or Christian leaders for the role they are to play. Jesus, the Master Teacher began with positive emphasis on righteous character and the blessings that it brings to the entire life of the believer. The Pharisees taught that righteousness was an external thing, a matter of obeying rules and regulations. In the Beatitudes, Jesus described the Christians character that flowed from within. The beatitudes describe the attitudes that ought to be in our lives today. He-attitudes (being attitudes raid not dome attitudes). Doing attitudes is that of the Pharisees and Sadducees.</h4>
                    <h4 style="text-align:justify;">Four types of attitudes mentioned in the beatitudes:</h4>
                    <h4 style="text-align:justify;">1.	Our attitude towards ourselves (vs. 2,3)</h4>
                    <h4 style="text-align:justify;">2.	Our attitude towards our sins (vs. 4-6)</h4>
                    <h4 style="text-align:justify;">3.	Our attitude towards the Lord (vs. 7-9).</h4>
                    <h4 style="text-align:justify;">4.	Our attitude towards the world (vs. 10-16).</h4>
                    <h4 style="text-align:justify;">These four kings of attitudes cover nine different characters a believer must have. This is another way of simplifying the nine fruits of the Spirit as in Galatians 5:22-23 (read in Amplified version of the bible). Love, Joy, Peace, Patience, Kindness, Goodness, Faithfulness, Gentleness and Self-control. While Matthew 5:1-12 emphasis is similar to compassion, poor in spirit, those who mourn, the meek, those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, the merciful, the pare in heart, the peacemakers and the persecuted.</h4>
                    
                    <h4 style="color: #9a7922;">1. Our attitude towards ourselves, Vs. 2&3</h4>
                    <h4 style="text-align: justify;">a. Compassion: Jesus saw the crowd and was moved toward their desperate plight and need. He knew He could not reach them by Himself, so He was driven to get alone with His disciples. He had to begin preparing them for their ministry to the large crowd.</h4>
                    <h4 style="text-align: justify;">Lesson (i): No one can accomplish the task alone, people are to be discipled so others must be taught to help in the great commission. Read Matthew 28:19-20; 2 Tim. 2:2.</h4>
                    <h4 style="text-align: justify;">Lesson (ii): Preaching and teaching are not to be done only in the fellowship out wherever people are found - on mountains, by the roadside, seaside, in homes, in classrooms hostels, any place and every place. Let's obey the Great Commission.</h4>
                    <h4 style="text-align: justify;">Lesson (iii): To be "blessed Greeks for Makarios" is what men should seek. The problem is that they seek the things of this earth -position, money, fame, power and sexual pleasure. Spiritual joy and satisfaction that last regardless of conditions, that carries one through pain, sorrow, loss and grief.</h4>
                    <h4 style="text-align: justify;">Lesson (iv): Man is ignorant of the kingdom of heaven, Matthew 19:20-24 (read). The young man went away very sad because Jesus asked for everything he had. We cannot love God with all our heart and yet keep our money to ourselves. Loving Him totally means using our money in ways that pleases Him. Jesus took the rich young ruler's rejection and warned all men about the dancers of wealth. The dangers that face the rich are real, terrible, entangling and enslaving, so the warning must be real and truthful. There is a lure, an attraction, a force, a power, a pull that reaches to draw us when we look at our possession or wealth.</h4>
                    <h4 style="text-align: justify;">It boosts ego, creates the big "I", it makes a person independent and self-sufficient in the world. The tendency is to live as if there is nothing they need, making them forget God. He forgets that there are things money cannot buy - riches tend to make a man selfish - the more we get, the more we want. Wealth attracts a person to the world. It makes a person to buy things that make him comfortable, pleases his taste, stirs his ego, expands his experience and his mental pursuits, stimulates his flesh and stretches his self-image.</h4>
                    <h4 style="text-align: justify;">Note: If a man centers his life upon things of the world, his attention is on the world and not on God. He tends to become wrapped up in securing more and in protecting what he has. He finds it difficult to contribute to the things of the kingdom. People pray for joy and dedicate themselves to God, they even give the little they have when the are seeking for God's help to promote or bless them. More often than not as soon as they get the good job or things turn better they become far from God giving excuses every day.</h4>
                    
                    <h4 style="color: #9a7922;">b. Poor in Spirit</h4>
                    <h4 style="text-align: justify;">Being poor in spirit does not mean a man must be poverty-stricken and financially poor, hungry, naked, etc. these are not pleasing to God, especially in the world of plenty. Christ is not talking about material poverty. It means to be humble. Humility is the foundation of Christian virtue. It is to have correct estimate of oneself. It does not mean that one does not have backbone at all. It means opposite of the world's attitude of self-praise and self-assertion. The poor in spirit are those who are conscious of their imperfections and orderliness before God, and never think they are better than other. It is a false humility that says, "I am not worth anything, I can't do anything by my strength". It is spiritual and physical lowliness, the conviction that our entire life and our spiritual and physical blessings, such as life, health, strength, spiritual ability, knowledge, riches and very good things of life, all these are the gift of our creator, God.</h4>
                    <h4 style="text-align: justify;">a. Those who Mourn</h4>
                    <h4 style="text-align: justify;">We mourn over sin and despise it. We see sin the way God sees it and seek to treat it the way God does. Those who cover sin or defined sin certainly have the wrong attitudes. The weeping represents true tribulations of the heart and repentant tears for our sins, weeping over our guilt before the merciful God. E.g. Peter's weeping after his renunciation. 1 Cor. 7:10. For godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation, not to be repented of but the sorrow of the world worketh death. Mourn is a Greek word, "Penthountes" meaning to have a broken heart. It is like the deep mourning and wailing that occurs over the death of a loved one. It is sorrow - a desperate, helpless sorrow. It is a sorrow for sin: broken heart over evil and suffering. A brokenness of self that comes from seeing Christ on the cross and realizing our sins led Him there.</h4>
                    
                    <h4 style="color: #9a7922;">2. Our attitude towards sin (vs. 4-6)</h4>
                    <h4 style="text-align: justify;">Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted, Matthew 5:4. Blessed are the meek, for they will inherit the earth. Matthew 5:5.</h4>
                    <h4 style="text-align: justify;">A. Those Who Mourn</h4>
                    <h4 style="text-align: justify;">We mourn over sin and despise it. We see sin the way God sees it and seek to treat it the way God does. Those who cover sin or defined sin certainly have the wrong attitudes. The weeping represents true tribulations of the heart and repentant tears for our sins, weeping over our guilt before the merciful God. E.g. Peter's weeping after his renunciation. 1 Cor. 7:10. For godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation, not to be repented of but the sorrow of the world worketh death. Mourn is a Greek word, "Penthountes" meaning to have a broken heart. It is like the deep mourning and wailing that occurs over the death of a loved one. It is sorrow - a desperate, helpless sorrow. It is a sorrow for sin: broken heart over evil and suffering. A brokenness of self that comes from seeing Christ on the cross and realizing our sins led Him there.</h4>
                    <h4 style="text-align: justify;"> Three kinds of persons that mourn:</h4>
                    <h4 style="text-align: justify;"> 1.	The person who is desperately sorry for his sins and unworthiness before God, e.g. they day I repented, the tax collector Luke 13:15 (read)</h4>
                    <h4 style="text-align: justify;"> 2.	The person who really feels the desperate plight and terrible sufferings of others. The tragedies, the problems, the sinful behavior of others, the condition of our nation and the world at large, all weigh ever heavily upon the heart of the mourner.</h4>
                    <h4 style="text-align: justify;"> 3.	The person who experiences personal tragedy and intense trauma. How are they comforted?</h4>
                    
                    <h4 style="text-align: justify;">i. There is a present comfort</h4>
                    <h4 style="text-align: justify;">A settled peace: A relief, a solace, a consolation within. John 14:27;16:33 (read) An assurance of forgiveness and acceptance by God. 1 John 1:9; 1:12 (read) A fullness of joy: A sense of God's presence, care and guidance, a sense of sovereignty, a sense of His working all things for good to those who love Him. Romans 8:28; Psalms 16:11 (read)</h4>
                    <h4 style="text-align: justify;">ii There is an Eternal Comfort</h4>
                    <h4 style="text-align: justify;">A passing from death to life, John 5:24; Isaiah 25:8 (read) A wiping away of all tears, Rev. 7:17; Rev. 21:4 (read).</h4>
                    
                    <h4 style="text-align: justify;">B. MEEK</h4>
                    <h4 style="text-align: justify;">Gentle, is a Greek word "Praeis", it means to have strong but tender and humble life. It is a strong yet teachable spirit. Not being weak. A man with all the emotions and ability to take and conquer is meek. He is a disciplined man because he is God - controlled. Moses was the meekest man in the bible. Opposite of meekness if arrogance and sense of superiority.</h4>
                    <h4 style="text-align: justify;">One who is meek; This person is self-controlled and not undisciplined. The mind and body are disciplined, never let loose. Passion and urges, speech and behavior, sigh and tough are always controlled, 1 Corinthians 6:12;9:27; James 3:2 (read).</h4>
                    <h4 style="text-align: justify;">The person who is humble, not prideful. He is humble before God and humble before men - he knows, he does not have it all and that he is not the epitome of knowledge. Rom. 12:3; Phil. 2:3 (read), The person who is forgiving, not revengeful, Matt. 6:14; Rom. 12:19; Rom. 12:21 (read). He quietly goes to God daily, depending upon God for guidance and care (read).He is quiet before men in both speech and behavior. 1 Tim. 2:2 (read).</h4>
                    
                    <h4 style="color: #9a7922;">How should the Meek Inherit the Earth.</h4>
                    <h4 style="text-align: justify;">They presently enjoy and experience the good things of the earth. They are strong and confident, yet tender and humble. Phil. 1:6 (read). They know where they are going, they have purpose meaning and significance in life. The meek control circumstances instead of letting circumstances control them.The meek have peaceful soul. They carry whatever pressure or stress that come their way to Christ. The earth is theirs, that is the new heavens and earth. </h4>
                    
                    <h4 style="text-align: justify;">C. Hunger and Thirst</h4>
                    <h4 style="text-align: justify;">It is real hunger and starvation of soul a person must starve and thirst for all righteousness if he wishes to be filled with the fullness of life.</h4>

            
                    <h4 style="color: #9a7922;">WHAT IS RIGHTEOUSNESS</h4>
                    <h4 style="text-align: justify;">Righteousness is the only thing that will fill and satisfy man's innermost need. Food and drink will not. Only God can fill and satisfy the deep need for permanent life. "Righteousness" in the bible means two things - to be right and to do right</h4>
                    <h4 style="text-align: justify;">But can the ordinary man be righteous since it is said that God alone is perfectly righteous? Man comes short of God's glory. The answer is what Christ says: "Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be filled", what happens is that God takes a person's hunger and thirst and counts it as righteousness. The person is not righteous but God counts him righteous. Righteousness involves the mind. The scripture says it involves being "made new in the attitude of your minds" (Eph. 4:23) and being renewed in knowledge" (Col. 3:10).</h4>
                    <h4 style="text-align: justify;">What does this mean? Very simple, the man who seeks after God is created to be like God in true righteousness and holiness. He puts on the new self or the new man made new in the attitude of his mind, (Eph. 4:23). Another way to say the same thing is this, the man who seeks after God has taken off his old self with its practices and has put on knowledge in the image of its creator (Col. 3:9).</h4>
                   
                    <h4 style="text-align: justify;">They Will be Filled</h4>
                    <h4 style="text-align: justify;">Meaning: Life in abundance - he believer who hunger and thirst for righteousness is wonderfully filled with both abundant life and eternal life.

                        •	He is full of goodness, complete in knowledge, (Rom. 15:14)
                        •	He is filled to the measure of all the fullness of God, (Eph. 3:19)
                        •	He is filled with the fruit of righteousness, (Phil. 1:11)
                        •	He is filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit (Acts 13:52)
                        
                        a.	Our attitudes towards the lord (vs. 7-9)
                        b.	Our attitudes towards to the world (vs. 10-16).
