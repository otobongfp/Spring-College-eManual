                <div style="margin-top: 50px;">
                    <h4 style="text-align:justify;">The word "Salvation" means to be delivered, safe, kept, healed and strong. God's love, mercy and grace brought salvation for all people, (Titus 2:11). Man had disobeyed God, but God had mercy, He love man. God had pity on the sinner and sent Jesus Christ to be the Saviour for all those who want to be saved. God saw man's need and did something to help even though man did nothing to deserve it. That is mercy. God did not and does not still love man's sin and disobedience. He loves man's soul and longs to restore/reconcile man to Himself in fellowship (John 3:16, Rom. 5:8).</h4>
                    
                    <h4 style="color: #9a7922;">THE NECESSITY OF SALVATION</h4>
                    <h4 style="text-align:justify;">1.	All men are sinners (Rom. 3:23, Ps. 51:5).</h4>
                    <h4 style="text-align:justify;">2.	All men must die, after which they must face the judgment of God (Heb. 9:27).</h4>
                    <h4 style="text-align:justify;">3.	Without being born again of the Spirit and water, no man can enter the kingdom of God (John 3:5).</h4>
                    
                    <h4 style="color: #9a7922;">GOD'S PLAN FOR MAN'S SALVATION</h4>
                    <h4 style="text-align: justify;">1. Adam and Eve committed sin of rebellion against God. He promised salvation through His Son (Rom 5:12,15)</h4>
                    <h4 style="text-align: justify;">2.	Jesus Christ, the Song of God took upon Himself the sins of all men, died on the cross and fulfilled the promise God had made to Adam and Eve (Isa. 53:5, Jn. 19:30)</h4>
                    <h4 style="text-align: justify;">3.	The Holy Spirit was given to guide and lead us to believe in the salvation that Christ made complete for mankind. (Jn. 15:26, 16:7-8).</h4>

                    <h4 style="color: #9a7922;">PRE-CONDITIONS FOR SALVATION</h4>
                    <h4 style="text-align: justify;">Repentance is the first step we take to receive the salvation that God offers to all humanity through faith in the Lord Jesus. It is the acknowledgement of our sins and being remorseful about it and then depending on the finished work of Christ at Calvary for salvation through faith in His word.</h4>
                   
                    <h4 style="color: #9a7922;">WHAT REPENTANCE IS NOT</h4>
                    <h4 style="text-align: justify;">1.	Just Feeling Guilty: Being remorseful and feeling guilty comes before one actually experiences repentance but it is not repentance in itself</h4>
                    <h4 style="text-align: justify;">2.	Just Trying to be a Good Person: Trying to please God by your own strength is not repentance, God is not pleased when we bring before Him self-righteousness (Isa. 64:6)</h4>
                    <h4 style="text-align: justify;">3.	Just Knowing the Truth: Having knowledge of the truth or scripture does not necessarily guarantees that the truth has become a living reality in one's life</h4>
                    <h4 style="text-align: justify;">4.	Just praying the sinner's prayer or attending the fellowship church</h4>
                    <h4 style="text-align: justify;">5.	Just giving offerings and tithing with the church/fellowship is not also repentance but religious activities/participation
                    <h4 style="text-align: justify;">6.	Just greeting or demonstrating loyalty to fellowship leaders in itself is not sign of repentance.</h4>

                    <h4 style="color: #9a7922;">WHAT IS TRUE REPENTANCE?</h4>
                    <h4 style="text-align: justify;">1.	Being sorry to God for your Sins: True repentance does not necessarily end at being remorseful but it is true sorrow towards God first, yourself and those affected as the case may be. (Ps. 51;17,2Cor. 7:9-10).</h4>
                    <h4 style="text-align: justify;">2.	Acknowledging your sins and confessing them: Once you recognize your sins, first admit it and make confession to the Lord about it. (Prov. 28:13,)</h4>
                    <h4 style="text-align: justify;">3.	Forsaking and hating sin: (Ps, 97:10, Prov. 8:13, Amos 5:15) after confession, there is need to forsake and abhor sing. This is possible through he helps of the Holy Spirit after God has granted you forgiveness. Repentance must be tied to action. Confession of sin and a changed life are inseparable</h4>
                    <h4 style="text-align: justify;">4.	Living a regenerated life in Christ: 2Cor.. 5:17, Rom. 12:1-2.</h4>

                    <h4 style="text-align: justify;">Most people are not very sure they are saved. When asked if they are saved, they can only say, "Well, I can't tell I hope so". But a person can know for sure that he is born again. The Holy Spirit will ^witness to his heart that the burden of sin has been taken away (Rom. 8:16).

                    <h4 style="text-align: justify;">Some people hope mat they will receive eternal life. They Bible says that we know that we have it.

                    <h4 style="color: #9a7922;">WAYS OF SUSTAINING THE NEW BIRTH</h4>
                    <h4 style="text-align: justify;">All babies need milk, water and breath to survive in life. In addition, they also need exercise and socialization to grow. When we become born again, we become spiritual newborn babies. Just like babies, we need these to sustain our spiritual lives, (1 Pet. 2:2). We need the spiritual milk (word of God), spiritual breath (prayer), spiritual exercise (witnessing) and spiritual socialization (fellowship).</h4>

                    <h4 style="color: #9a7922;">B. Prayer</h4>
                    <h4 style="text-align: justify;">Prayer is what helps to establish and sustain our relationship with God. Matt. 6:9 it places our focus on God. Matt. 6:9</h4>
                    <h4 style="text-align: justify;">a.	Prayer brings us to a high spiritual frequency and puts everything under our control. (Phil. 4:6. James 5:17)</h4>
                    <h4 style="text-align: justify;">b.	Evangelism is made effective through prayer. Lk. 10:2</h4>

                    <h4 style="text-align: justify;">We have a responsibility to share the testimony of our faith with others. Acts 1:8 recommends that we start from our family, roommates, departments, hostels, etc. It is essential for spiritual growth. A simple but well intended invitation to fellowship, consistent follow-up via SMS, visitation, prayers and show of love can be very productive. The consequences of not witnessing are in 2 Tim. 2:12.</h4>
                    
                    <h4 style="color: #9a7922;">D. Fellowship</h4>
                    <h4 style="text-align: justify;">Fellow shipping together is very important for or spiritual growth because the believer is encouraged and sharpened by contact with others. Heb. 10:25, Prov. 27:17. The world comes to know Jesus through our unity and love (Jn. 17:22-23). Consistent fellowship with brethren is a basic factor that guarantees our spiritual growth.</h4>
