                <div style="margin-top: 50px;">
                    <h4 style="text-align:justify;">The baptism of the Holy Spirit refers to the experience of being prayerfully submitted and controlled by the Holy Spirit. It is an infilling in one's life by the Holy Spirit who comes in to dwell and inhabit mat life. The baptism of the Holy Spirit is an outpouring of the Spirit. Joel 2:28.</h4>
                    <h4 style="text-align:justify;">Every born-again believer has the Spirit of God but not every believer has been baptized in the Holy Spirit. Until a believer is baptized in the Holy Spirit he or she lacks the power to function as an Ambassador of Christ on earth. After Jesus was taken up to heaven, He would be present everywhere through the Holy Spirit. The comforter sent by the father would be with and within his followers after He returned to heaven. Jesus promised his disciples the Holy Spirit who would comfort them, guide them to know all truth, remind them of Jesus word, give them the right words to say and fill then with power. John 16:7-16.</h4>
                    <h4 style="color: #9a7922;">A. THE WORKS OF THE HOLYSPIRIT</h4>
                    <h4 style="text-align:justify;">1.	He convicts the world of three things: John 16:8-10
                        1.	Sin: The sins of those who have not accepted or Lord Jesus Christ

                        2.	Self-Righteousness: The pride of man who tries to become righteous on his own

                        3.	Judgment: The judgment of Satan who does his evil deeds in this world
                    <h4 style="text-align:justify;">2.	He makes us holy when we focus our lives toward pleasing God and following His will, the Holy Spirit guides us towards righteous and Holiness. 1 Cor. 6:11.</h4>
                    <h4 style="text-align:justify;">3.	The Holy Spirit teaches all truth: He uses the word of God to train us and to strengthen our faith. (John 16:13).</h4>
                    <h4 style="text-align:justify;">4.	The Spirit marks the beginning of the Christian experiences. We cannot belong to Christ without His Spirit (Rom. 8:9). We cannot be converted to Christ without His Spirit convincing and convicting us (1 Cor. 6:17); we cannot be adopted as His Spirit (Rom. 8:14-1 7: Gal.6-7). We cannot in the body of Christ except by baptism in the Spirit (1 Con 12:13).</h4>
                    <h4 style="text-align:justify;">5.	The Spirit is the power of our new lives: (Luke 2-1:-19; Rom. Rom8:11). The Holy Spirit begins a life-long process of change in us as He molds us to become like Christ. Once we receive immediate personal relationship with God.</h4>
                    <h4 style="text-align:justify;">6.	The Spirit unites the Christian a community in Christ (Eph. 2:19-22). The Holy Spirit can be experienced by all and through all (Eph. 2:16). The experience of being filled with the Spirit is and should be an ongoing process we should not be concerned with how much of the Holy Spirit has. We need to submit ourselves daily to his leading and draw constantly on hip power.</h4>
                    <h4 style="text-align:justify;">7.	The Holy -Spirit is our purifier. In Acts 2:3-4, there was a fulfillment of John the John the Baptist words about the Holy Spirit baptizing with fire (Lk. 3:16) and Prophet Joel's words about the outpouring of the Holy Spirit (Joel 2:28-29).</h4>
                   
                    <h4 style="color: #9a7922;">WHY TONGUES OF FIRE?</h4>
                    <h4 style="text-align: justify;">Tongues symbolizes speech and the communication, of the gospel. Fire symbolizes God's purifying presence which burns away the undesirable elements of our lives and sets cur hearts aflame to ignite the hearts of others. As fire came down at Pentecost symbolizing tat God's presence is now available to all who believe in Him.</h4>

This was his own narration of his first encounter with the Holy Spirit, prior to this the young man had given his life to the Lordship of Jesus 2years back, but still he hoped to get the tangible experience of Pentecost.
