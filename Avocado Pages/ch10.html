                <!-- THIS IS THE INTRO PAGE CONTENTS -->
                <div style="margin-top: 50px;">
                    <h4 style="text-align:justify;">As Ambassadors for Christ, we have been sent to wherever we find ourselves to represent Christ and His kingdom. We must hold unto and advocate the basic trust and mission of our home government, which is reconciling men unto God. After God created the earth, He gave authority on earth to man, when man failed and God needed to come to the earth, He came through Jesus in form of man. And when Jesus ascended to heaven He gave us (man) the Holy Spirit who dwells in us to operate in this world. The bible calls us the body of Christ because if we refuse to do anything, God can do nothing. Jesus has need of us to reach the unreached.</h4>
                    <h4 style="text-align:justify;">If the Christ you received is worth having, is worth sharing with others. If the truth (the word) you have experienced and believed is good, it is expedient you share your testimony. A testimony is evidence given by a witness and a witness is a person who shares a testimony. Thus, you cannot be an effective witness without having an experience of what you are sharing. A transformed life is an effective witness to the power of God's word (Phil. 2:14-16). Jesus commanded His disciples to witness to all nations about Him (Acts 1:8, Matt. 28:19-20). Jesus promised His disciples that they shall receive power to witness after they had received the Holy Spirit.</h4>
                    <h4 style="color: #9a7922;">NOTE THE PROGRESSION</h4>
                    <h4 style="text-align:justify;">1.	The would receive the Holy Spirit (Acts 2:4).</h4>
                    <h4 style="text-align:justify;">2.	He would give them power, (Acts 1:8).</h4>
                    <h4 style="text-align:justify;">3.	They would witness with extraordinary results, (Mark 16:15)</h4>
                    <h4 style="text-align:justify;">Jesus had no difficulty associating with sinners because He loved them and knew that they needed to hear what He had to say. Jesus spent time with whoever needed or wanted to hear His message i.e., the poor rich, good, bad, sick educated, Jews or Gentiles. We too must be friends to those who need Christ even if they do seem to be bad companions or too far from God.</h4>
                    
                    <h4 style="color: #9a7922;">B.	ALWAYS SHARE YOUR EXPERIENCE</h4>
                    <h4 style="text-align: justify;">1.	At everywhere and at every opportunity (Mk. 1:38,1 Pet.3:15)</h4>
                    <h4 style="text-align: justify;">2.	Without fear or shame (Rom. l:16;2Tim. 1:7)</h4>
                    <h4 style="text-align: justify;">3.	With family members, friends, roommates, course mates and everyone you come across. (Matt. 28:19; Mark 16:15)</h4>
                    <h4 style="text-align: justify;">4.	No matter the cost (Acts5:40).</h4>
            
                    <h4 style="color: #9a7922;">C. DEVELOP THE PASSION AND CONCERN TO WITNESS</h4>
                    <h4 style="text-align: justify;">1.	Never assume someone doesn't want to know God, by his/her background, lifestyle or appearance. (1 Tim. 1:12-16)</h4>
                    <h4 style="text-align: justify;">2.	Don't be preoccupied with your faith that you don't share it.</h4>
                    <h4 style="text-align: justify;">3.	Don't judge sinners but love them. (Matt. 7:1; Luke 6:37)</h4>
                    <h4 style="text-align: justify;">4.	Use others curiosity about your Christian lifestyle and values as an opener to share how Christ has made a difference in you. (Matt. 3:4-6).</h4>
                    <h4 style="text-align: justify;">5.	Point to Christ not yourself. (1 Thess. 2:6-8) use Christ as our example.</h4>
                    <h4 style="text-align: justify;">6.	You could try other methods/approaches but never distort the message/word of God. (Acts 17:30-31; 2 Cor. 4:2; 1 Thess. 2:40-8)</h4>
                    <h4 style="text-align: justify;">7.	Don't assume that religious" people know about Jesus. (Acts 17:23).</h4>
                    <h4 style="text-align: justify;">Witnessing/evangelism is our greatest responsibility on earth, (2 Tim. 4:1-2; Heel. 12: 13). It is heaven's mandate for every believer we are to go; whether it is the next door or to another country and make disciples. It is not an option, but a command to all who call Jesus "Lord". We are not all evangelists in the formal sense, but we have all received gifts that we can use to help fulfill the great commission. (Matt. 28:18-20). Remember, ''Me that wins a soul is wise", (Prov. 11:30b), your reward awaits you in heaven.</h4>
                    <h4 style="text-align: justify;">We are on this campus primarily for academics but also to win souls for Christ. His grace, divine health, blessings and grace you expect from God is made easy and possible by kingdom increase.</h4>
                    <h4 style="text-align: justify;">Believers overs are not on earth for heaven. We are not training to become good heavenly candidates. We are here to make the good news of the kingdom known to everybody.</h4>
                    
                    <h4 style="color: #9a7922;">D.	METHODS OF WITNESSING</h4>
                    <h4 style="text-align: justify;">1.	Sharing the gospel with a course mate, roommate, a friend, colleague; (John l:43-51;3:l-3;l-I3)etc.</h4>
                    <h4 style="text-align: justify;">2.	Living a Christ-like life of purity and love (Phil. 2:5-8).</h4>
                    <h4 style="text-align: justify;">3.	Inviting one to fellowship.</h4>
                    <h4 style="text-align: justify;">4.	Text messages, short visits, follow-up, prayers, etc.</h4>
                    <h4 style="text-align: justify;">5.	Lending genuine help at critical moments</h4>
                    <h4 style="text-align: justify;">6.	Sharing testimonies of what God is doing for brethren in you fellowship.</h4>
                    <h4 style="text-align: justify;">7.	Speaking well of the fellowship and the leadership. A believer who does not witness experience weaknesses an effective and efficient witnessing is a precinct of focused prayer(s). Jesus never witnessed until He had prayed. The steering four wheels of fruitful witnessing is the Holy Ghost. Jesus told His disciples to tarry until they received power from on high.</h4>

                    <h4 style="color: #9a7922;">LIFE APPLICATION</h4>
                    <h4 style="text-align: justify;">Unlike every other born again Chaster, Christian lady, Susan felt shy, timid and embarrassed when it came to preaching Jesus Christ on campus. She could gather courage (o preach somewhere else but not on campus.</h4>
                    <h4 style="text-align: justify;">It was too demeaning; this meant she'll have to watch her speech and action, even dressing. No! She couldn't compromise her elegance for evangelism and all that she was okay with Christianity being in the church, but outside life should be more social, fun and nil that she just couldn't.</h4>
                    <h4 style="text-align: justify;">Her best friend Maria was a worldly girl, she drank, partied and had sex like it was drugs and didn't mind laying with men her fathers age. One afternoon both ladies decided to grab lunch at an eatery outside the university campus. Again that great nutch came to Susan's mind ''preach to your friend". As what she required it, 2 minute later their vehicle was run into by a full speed trailer. Susan woke- up two weeks later, as the only survivor of the crash oh! She sobbed where would Maria be? If she had but led Maria to Christ. 25years later Susan is a well-known evangelist, leading men to Jesus but she lived continually to remember the life of her best friend who she would have led to Christ.</h4>
