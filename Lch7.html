                <img class="img-thumbnail2" src="Lavender Images/Consecration2.png">

                <!-- THIS IS THE INTRO PAGE CONTENTS -->
                <div style="margin-top: 50px;">
                    <h5 style="text-align:justify;">This has to do with our peculiarity, uniqueness and difference from others. It is a scope of guide for the way we live and conduct our lives in this household of faith. In fact, this topic defines our personality and distinguishes us as Ambassadors on campus. These consecration guides as adopted by the fellowship serves as our statuesque as it helps us to portray our message effectively without any bias in the mind of our hearers.</h5>

                    <h3 style="color: #611635;">WHAT ARE THESE CONSECRATION GUIDES?</h3>
                    <h5 style="color: #611635;">1.  Appearance</h5>
                    <h5 style="text-align:justify;">We are to dress modestly, in ways that will glorify God. You preach the gospel effectively when you look good, smart and presentable telling others you don't serve a poor God. Ladies are not to wear trousers or abuse make-ups. They are to attend fellowship meetings with their head ties. The young men are not to wear ear earrings, rings and necklace and sag their trousers or dress immodestly. Neither are they meant to drink alcohol or smoke. They might not be seen as sin by certain individuals including sister fellowships, but they will act as a clog in the wheel of progress of our ministry. Since we have a focus (reaching out) we have to abstain from them for our message to be effective, Heb. 12:1. We should possess the following:</h5>
                    <h5 style="text-align: justify;">1.	Peaceful Living: Col. 3:15, 2 Tim. 2:22, James 3:18, 1 Thes.5:3b, Matt. 5:9.</h5>
                    <h5 style="text-align: justify;">2.	Obedient Lifestyle: 1 Pet. 1:14, Phil. 2:8</h5>
                    <h5 style="text-align: justify;">3.	Humility: Phil. 2:3, Matt. 5:5, Mark 11:29</h5>
                    <h5 style="text-align: justify;">4.	Forgiveness: Malt. 5:23-24, Matt. 6:12,2 Tim. 2:24</h5>
                    <h5 style="text-align: justify;">5.	Contentment: 1 Tim. 6:6, Phil. 4:11, 12:- We must be contented with what we have. It is when we want to have more than we ought to, that we fall into temptations as a result of greed. Both in physical and spiritual things we must learn to be contented or face the consequences of such nets (Josh. 7,2 Kings 5:19-27).</h5>
                    <h5 style="text-align: justify;">6.	Commitment in the household of faith: Col. 3:23-24, Prov. 27, John 9:4.</h5>
                    <h5 style="text-align: justify;">7.	Watch the way you talk: Eph. 4:29, Prov. 20:15, Prov. 21:23, James 1:26", Col</h5>
                    <h5 style="text-align: justify;">•	No member of CASOR is to "Sort" any lecturer or lecturer's representative either in cash or kind. Any member of CASOR who is threatened by a lecturer that he/she will be failed if he/she doesn't sort, or if he/she doesn't engage in sexual immorality with him/her must report this to the President of the fellowship.</h5>
                    <h5 style="text-align: justify;">•	No member of CASOR is to engage in any dishonest act as it pertains to impersonating to write test or examination in this institution and beyond.</h5>
 

                    <h5 style="color: #611635;">2.  Cultural Practices</h5>
                    <h5 style="text-align: justify;">The stand of the fellowship is that although a member of the fellowship may be a member of his cultural association or union, serve in an official capacity and attend the reception for new members, he/she must not engage in any cultural procession or in any activity that is inconsistent with the bible.</h5>

                    <h5 style="color: #611635;">3.  Rag Day</h5>
                    <h5 style="text-align: justify;">Since the philosophy of rag day has been overturned and misplaced, no member of CASOR should ever participate in rag day. No member of CASOR should rag, either on campus or outside the campus, we are Royal Priesthoods (Brothers) Daughters of victory (Sisters). We are Princes and Princesses of God and thus, will not represent our Father properly on Rag Uniform, God alone is our source as ragging reduces the place of God in your financial life.</h5>

                    <h5 style="color: #611635;">4.  Campus Life</h5>
                    <h5 style="text-align: justify;">The university is a community that brings together people from all backgrounds, the unsaved, the good, the bad, the corrupt, etc. as believers on campus, we ought to live as the salt of the earth. (Matt. 5:13) we ought to be careful about the associations, organizations, club, etc. that we join. We must shun associations that engage in acts inconsistent with the bible. Note that no man can serve two masters as light darkness are no relations.</h5>
                    <h5 style="text-align: justify;">In classroom, we must manifest Christ and shine as the light (Matt. 5:4-16). Everything we say or do should reflect our nature as Christians. We must make people know our do's and don'ts (godly principles) before it is too late.</h5>

                    <h5 style="color: #611635;">5. Sharing Rooms with the Unsaved</h5>
                    <h5 style="text-align: justify;">When we live in the same room with unbelievers, we must live as light. We should not mastermind trouble making or quarreling. We must live honestly and as much as it lies in us, live at peace with all our roommates and neighbors. However, we must not allow ourselves to be harassed, intimidated or threatened by anyone. In any case of harassment or threat should be reported to the hostel hall pastor who shall bring such case to the president if need be. As believers, we ought to comply with the rules and regulations of our hostels or blocks, so long as they are not inconsistent with the provisions of the bible.</h5>

                    <h5 style="color: #611635;">6. Campus Politics</h5>
                    <h5 style="text-align: justify;">Members of CASOR are encouraged to participate in politics by voting or contesting for offices. However, while contesting for offices or voting, we must comply with the rules and regulations of the election.</h5>

                    <h5 style="color: #611635;">6. Campus Politics</h5>
                    <h5 style="text-align: justify;">Members of CASOR are encouraged to participate in politics by voting or contesting for offices. However, while contesting for offices or voting, we must comply with the rules and regulations of the election.</h5>

                    <h5 style="color: #611635;">7. Cultism</h5>
                    <h5 style="text-align: justify;">Today, cultism and its related activities constitute a serious threat on our campus and the society at large. Because of this, much damage has been done to youths, families and societies at large. These harms are physical, spiritual and psychological. The spirit watch organization also defined "cult" as a social group formed within the larger societies of mankind that are in an active tension with the existing social order out of which they come.</h5>
                    <h5 style="text-align: justify;">There is abuse of power and authority by manipulative, unscrupulous leadership who control followers by fear and deception to fulfill their agenda at the followers' expense. Occult groups can be said to be following one man or the groups teaching with the belief to offer salvation, fulfillment, enlightenment, fame, power and all kinds of material wants, etc. It is dangerous. You will find unethical forms of manipulation, deception and mind control to compel a member's submission to the group authority by involuntary/voluntary means. The consequences of involvement with such a toxic community of faith usually include religious abuse, psychological damage and social disruption both within and outside the school secret cults are evil. Do not join them. The lives of cult members are always lived in isolation from those people that live normal lives. They are not happy with the life style they have chosen but find it difficult to turn back. They are blind fools who run after material things. Their moment of joy is not up to 10% as compared to the sufferings, pains and mental torture they go through as a result of being members of the cults.</h5>
                    <h5 style="text-align: justify;">They are always on the run trying to get off the hook of death meanwhile they are brutal killers who, though, sometimes, are not willing to kill but do so because of the oath they swore during the time of initiation. Though some cult members are victims seeking revenge for the death of their loved ones, the truth still remains that whatever made them join secret cults is bad and must not be reckoned with. What may seem right in the eyes of men sometimes lead to destruction (Prov. 14:12). People kill themselves to get richer and more powerful but the question is; after acquiring this power and gathering all these riches, where is your soul going to spend eternity? (Mark 8:36-37). We are mortals and one day every man shall surely die and leave the vanity of life behind to face judgment. But there is a way out, my friend: Jesus is the only way (John 14:6), the way of joy and true happiness. Turn to Jesus today and He will do you good.</h5>

                    <h5 style="color: #611635;">Secret Cult</h5>
                    <h5 style="text-align: justify;">There are different types of secret cults in the university(ies) and the ones mentioned below are some of them:-</h5>
                    <h5 style="text-align: justify;">1.	Black movement of African, "Black Axe"</h5>
                    <h5 style="text-align: justify;">2.	Supreme Vikings confraternity [norse men]</h5>
                    <h5 style="text-align: justify;">3.	MAT</h5>
                    <h5 style="text-align: justify;">4.	MAFIA</h5>
                    <h5 style="text-align: justify;">5.	Buccaneers</h5>
                    <h5 style="text-align: justify;">6.	Aye</h5>
                    <h5 style="text-align: justify;">7.	Kiasmen</h5>
                    <h5 style="text-align: justify;">8.	Vi-Queens</h5>
                    <h5 style="text-align: justify;"> 9. Lady Jezebel</h5>
                    <h5 style="text-align: justify;">10. Lesbian club</h5>
                    <h5 style="text-align: justify;">11. Amazon</h5>
                    <h5 style="text-align: justify;">12. Pink ladies</h5>
                    <h5 style="text-align: justify;">13. Orange girls</h5>
                    <h5 style="text-align: justify;">14. Daughters of doom</h5>
                    <h5 style="text-align: justify;">15. Black Bra... They are all traced down to the establishment of the popular pirates' confraternity in the year 1952 at the College of Ibadan.</h5>

                    <h5 style="color: #611635;">CASOR COVENANT</h5>
                    <h5 style="text-align: justify;">A covenant is a solemn agreement between parties which attract duties and confer rights and benefits subject to the express and/or implied terms (mutual promises). God is a covenant keeping God (Gen. 9: 15, Num. 8:19, Exo. 34:28, Jer. 31:32-33, Heb. 8:6-13). As children of God, we are partakers of a new, better superior covenant in Chris; (Eph. 2:2-1 8, Heb. 8:6). CASOR has a solemn, subsisting, valid and efficacious covenant with God that "NO CASORITE DIES ON CAMI'US". It is our cherished legacy that God has faithfully sustained over the years. In Psalms S9:3-l, He said “I will not break my covenant with them nor take back even one promise I make”. The covenant is a life assurance policy that now covers your immediate family. You cannot die or lose your guardian as an active member of CASOR. (Jer. 2S:1S). The covenant guarantees excellence in one’s academic; wisdom to appropriate it rightly is the key. As we apply discipline, sacrifice and faith actions, through the CASOR Seed faith known as, “CASORITE SKIP A MEAL IN A WEEK” which goes into flic fellowship covenant trust fund, our financial dimension is boosted and financial yokes are broken as one's financial security in school and here after is sustained. The fellowship also has cm altar of prayer which you must be part of.</h5>

                    <h5 style="color: #611635;">NATURE OF THE COVENANT</h5>
                    <h5 style="text-align: justify;">It is between God and CASOR, all CASORITES are beneficiaries. It is potent, efficacious and effective for more than fifteen years of its existence en campus and God has been faithful. It is superior and thus supersedes all cur individual, family or group covenants. Our duty under this covenant is purity i.e. holy, righteous and sanctified living. Sanctity is stressed and holiness our watchdog. God is ever faithful in keeping His promises as it has to do with the covenant. It is left for yen to fulfill your part. We cannot hide under the shield of the covenant because we come to fellowship and live in sin. The same covenant will frustrate you if you do so. The covenant, however, cannot fall in our time because God cannot lie nor is He a respecter of persons. Take advantage of it even over your families. Speak the covenant, act the covenant and enjoy divine diplomatic immunity. The thing dey work!</h5>
                    
                    <h5 style="color: #611635;">CONCLUSION</h5>
                    <h5 style="text-align: justify;">Some people who say that they are born again are not living sanctified and consecrated lives so they suffer again. It is evident.</h5>
