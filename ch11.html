                <div style="margin-top: 50px;">
                    <h5 style="color: #9a7922;">A. TEMPTATION</h5>
                    <h5 style="text-align:justify;">Satan attacks every Christian mostly by tempting him/her. He concentrates these assaults in two areas.</h5>
                    
                    <h5 style="color: #9a7922;">1. The Desire of the Flesh</h5>
                    <h5 style="text-align: justify;">Through the finished work of Christ on the cross, every true Christian is delivered from the consequences of sin and from the power of sin (Rom. 6:6-14). However, the believer still lives in a physical body that is subjected to natural appetites and desire. The young girl is beautiful and sexually appealing. The you man is handsome and sexually active with an urge just to try it. Every feels it one time or the other. Satan uses these to try and get a Christian to place greater importance upon them than the prompting of the Holy Spirit (Rom. 8:5-9; James 1:14; Eph. 2:3). Thus, this calls for Godly discipline and self-control (1 Cor. 9:27).</h5>
                    
                    <h5 style="color: #9a7922;">2. The Desire of the World</h5>
                    <h5 style="text-align: justify;">•	By making the material blessings that the world offers a central desire</h5>
                    <h5 style="text-align: justify;">•	Making honor, money, fame and recognition of this world an important goal</h5>
                    <h5 style="text-align: justify;">•	To make the comfort of being one with people of this world our basis for security.</h5>
                    <h5 style="text-align: justify;">•	The campus environment is a world of its own. A city in the universe with so many attractions and distraction. Sex, cultism, examination malpractice, threats and fear of failure are common in a campus environment and the devil uses them to tempt a believer. Listen to this: "Do not love the world or anything in the world; if anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him". (1 Jn. 2:15) also (James 4:4; 1 Tim. 6:6-11).</h5>
                   
                    <h5 style="color: #9a7922;">SATAN'S FALSE VICTORY AT EDEN </h5>
                    <h5 style="text-align: justify;">The first man and woman were defeated by Satan in the area of the desire of the flesh and the world. These are still his antics and tactics till today.</h5>
                    <h5 style="text-align: justify;">The bible has this to say in 1 Jn.2:16 (Amp.) "for all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh (craving for sexual gratification), and the lust of the eyes (greed, loneliness of the mind) and the pride of life (assurance in ones' own resources or in the stability of earthly things) world (itself)" </h5>
                    
                    <h5 style="color: #9a7922;">THE CHRISTIANS CONTINUAL VICTORY</h5>
                    <h5 style="text-align: justify;">Consequent upon the foundation of this great victory won for us by Jesus Christ, the Christian can readily defeat any attack from the enemy. Here are some keys to continual victory:</h5>
                    <h5 style="text-align: justify;">i. Know that the victory is already won because of His defeat at the cross: The devil’s only strength now is found in a Christian's ignorance (Hosea 4:6). Once a Christian knows the effect of the complete work of Christ on the cross and resurrection in His life, the devil is stripped of any weapon against him.</h5>
                    <h5 style="text-align: justify;">ii. Walk in step with the Spirit: There’s a new reservoir of power deposited within the Christian, which is the Holy Spirit Himself. We need to walk in obedience to His inner prompting day-by-day (Gal. 5:22-25), fruits of the Spirit.</h5>
                    <h5 style="text-align: justify;">iii.	Recognize temptation for what it is: Temptation itself is not sin but yielding to temptation is sin! (James 1:15).</h5>
                    <h5 style="text-align: justify;">iv. Understanding there is a way to escape prodded: Details of ways of escaping from temptation are provided in 1 Cor. 10:13, James 4:7; "Submit to God, resist the devil and he will flee".</h5>
                    <h5 style="text-align: justify;">v. Keep the right focus in life: "If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above...not those things which are on earth" (Col.3:1-2;PM. 4:8; 1 Tim. 6:ll;2Pet. 3:11-13).</h5>
                    <h5 style="text-align: justify;">vi. Beware of Satan's Scheme: It is important for us to know the tactics the devil employs against us so that we are not outwitted by him (2 Cor. 2:11).</h5>
                    <h5 style="text-align: justify;">Be purposeful against temptation: Make up your mind of the kind of Christian you want to be and how you want to respond to temptation before you are tempted (Dan. 1:8). However, God does not allow you to be tempted beyond what you can bear.</h5>
            
                    <h5 style="color: #9a7922;">B. TRIAL OF FAITH</h5>
                    <h5 style="text-align: justify;">This is a period of testing. Everything happening around appears contrary to what God has said and there appears to be no evidence for our believing naturally speaking. At a point like this, our faith rests completely on God's word (what He has spoken concerning you), "herein ye greatly rejoice, though for a season (a little while), if need be, ye are in heaviness (suffering, anxieties and fear) through manifold temptation: that the trial of your faith; being much more precious than of gold that perisheth, though it may be tried with fire, might he found unto praise and honor and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ", (1 Pet. 1:6-7; Rom. 4:16-21; Ps. 105:17-19). Deny himself (2 Tim. 2:13). Jesus showed didn't abandon them, "He will never leave us nor forsake us" (Heb. 13:5).</h5>
            
                    <h5 style="color: #9a7922;">C. SUFFERING</h5>
                    <h5 style="text-align: justify;">When docs one "suffer" and how? Although suffering in this context does not literally mean mediocrity, pain, poverty, failure, etc. Everyone on earth is bound to suffer in one way of the other during any of the following situations.</h5>
                    <h5 style="text-align: justify;">i.	When one falls into temptation: Adam and Eve suffered when they fell into temptation (Gen. 3:1). They succumbed to the temptation of the devil, which brought about suffering on the whole earth. Samson and Delilah in Judges 16 and David and Bathsheba in 2 Samuel 11,12:10-12.</h5>
                    <h5 style="text-align: justify;">ii.    When one lives in disobedience to God and His word: Whosoever refuses to repent from his/her sinful lifestyle and continues to be disobedient to the word of God, suffers. This Pharaoh (who did not know Joseph) (Exo. 14), Nebuchadnezzar (Daniel 4), Sampson (Judges 16), The rich man (Luke 16:19-30).</h5>
                    <h5 style="text-align: justify;">iii.	During trial of faith: Here a Christian is called to suffer with Christ. It is actually called fellowship. "That I may know Him and Him and the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His suffering..:' (Phil. 3:10)."If we suffer (with Christ) we shall also reign with Him..." (2 Ti m. 2:12).</h5>
